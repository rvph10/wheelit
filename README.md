## 🎯 Team Constraints (NEW!)

The team mode now supports advanced constraints to create more balanced and fair teams:

### How It Works

1. Go to **Setup** and select **Teams Mode**
2. Click **"Manage"** next to "Team Constraints"
3. Select pairs of items that should **not** be placed on the same team
4. The algorithm will automatically ensure these constraints are respected when creating teams

### Use Cases

- **Sports Teams**: Separate the strongest players across different teams
- **Work Groups**: Avoid putting team leads together
- **Study Groups**: Balance skill levels by separating experienced members
- **Event Planning**: Ensure diverse representation across teams

### Technical Implementation

- Smart constraint-aware team creation algorithm
- Fallback mechanisms for impossible constraint scenarios
- Preserved in shared URLs and exports
- Visual indicators in the results showing which constraints were applied
